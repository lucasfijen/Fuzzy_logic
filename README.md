# Fuzzy_logic
# project by Arie Soeteman and Lucas Fijen

# Two python files have been created for the interaction with the
# For now self-created database. The plan is that next week the actual database
# will be converted to the datastructure as presented here.

# To run this code, run the ipython file using Jupyter notebook.
# The whole project is written in Python 3.6, using numpy as package
